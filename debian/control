Description: Common support for todo.txt packages
 The Todo.txt project defines a format for supporting context-rich tasking in a
 plain text file. It supports an ecosystem of tools which allow working with
 tasks across hosts and operating systems.
 .
 This package adds helper programs to aid in editing and viewing todo.txt
 tasking files, and adds a hook mechanism for use by other packages. It should
 not be necessary to install it directly.
